    <h1>1.4 Assignment</h1>
    <p> There’s something quietly beautiful about the way abandoned places tell stories without words. A rusted swing set, swaying ever so slightly in the breeze; cracked tiles that once gleamed under fluorescent lights; a forgotten coffee mug still sitting on a desk—these are the artifacts of lives once vivid. Decay, in a strange way, is memory preserved. Every peeling wall and broken window whispers fragments of human presence, a slow surrender to time that transforms what was once ordinary into something almost sacred.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, technology races in the opposite direction—toward perfection, speed, and constant renewal. Devices grow thinner, faster, and more disposable with each passing year, leaving behind digital ruins of their own: obsolete code, dead links, forgotten accounts. There’s a kind of irony in how our quest for innovation often mirrors nature’s entropy. Both systems—organic and digital—move through cycles of creation and decay, but in technology, we hide the decay behind glossy updates and cloud storage. The data may live forever, but meaning fades the moment we stop looking. </p>
    <p>Perhaps that’s why nostalgia feels so heavy now. In a world that moves too fast to notice itself, we cling to the remnants that stay still. A photograph printed on paper instead of pixels, a song played from an old cassette, the handwritten note tucked inside a book—all reminders that permanence isn’t the same as preservation. What lasts isn’t the object or the medium, but the feeling that lingers when we remember. </p>
